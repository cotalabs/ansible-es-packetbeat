################### Packetbeat Configuration Example ##########################

# This file contains an overview of various configuration settings. Please consult
# the docs at https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/beats/packetbeat/current/packetbeat-configuration.html
# for more details.

# The Packetbeat shipper works by sniffing the network traffic between your
# application components. It inserts meta-data about each transaction into
# Elasticsearch.

############################# Sniffer #########################################

# Select the network interfaces to sniff the data. You can use the "any"
# keyword to sniff on all connected interfaces.
interfaces:
  device: {{ es_packetbeat_interface }}

############################# Protocols #######################################
protocols:
{% for item in es_packetbeat_protocols %}
  {{ item.name }}:
    ports: [{% for port in item.ports %}{{ port }}{% if not loop.last %}, {% endif %}{% endfor %}]
{%   if item.name == "dns" %}
    include_authorities: {{ item.include_authorities|lower }}
    include_additionals: {{ item.include_additionals|lower }}
    send_request: {{ item.send_request|lower }}
    send_response: {{ item.send_response|lower }}
{%   endif %}
{% endfor %}

############################# Processes #######################################

# Configure the processes to be monitored and how to find them. If a process is
# monitored then Packetbeat attempts to use it's name to fill in the `proc` and
# `client_proc` fields.
# The processes can be found by searching their command line by a given string.
#
# Process matching is optional and can be enabled by uncommenting the following
# lines.
#
#procs:
#  enabled: false
#  monitored:
#    - process: mysqld
#      cmdline_grep: mysqld
#
#    - process: pgsql
#      cmdline_grep: postgres
#
#    - process: nginx
#      cmdline_grep: nginx
#
#    - process: app
#      cmdline_grep: gunicorn

############################# Libbeat Config ##################################

############################# Output ##########################################

# Configure what outputs to use when sending the data collected by the beat.
# Multiple outputs may be used.

    # Set gzip compression level.

    # Optional index name. The default index name depends on the each beat.
    # For Packetbeat, the default is set to packetbeat, for Topbeat
    # top topbeat and for Filebeat to filebeat.

  ### File as output
  #file:
    # Path to the directory where to save the generated files. The option is mandatory.

############################# Shipper #########################################

shipper:
  # The name of the shipper that publishes the network data. It can be used to group
  # all the transactions sent by a single shipper in the web interface.
  # If this options is not defined, the hostname is used.
  #name:

  # The tags of the shipper are included in their own field with each
  # transaction published. Tags make it easy to group servers by different
  # logical properties.
  #tags: ["service-X", "web-tier"]

  # Uncomment the following if you want to ignore transactions created
  # by the server on which the shipper is installed. This option is useful
  # to remove duplicates if shippers are installed on multiple servers.
  #ignore_outgoing: true

  # How often (in seconds) shippers are publishing their IPs to the topology map.
  # The default is 10 seconds.
  #refresh_topology_freq: 10

  # Expiration time (in seconds) of the IPs published by a shipper to the topology map.

  # To enable logging to files, to_files option has to be set to true
  files:
    # The directory where the log files will written to.
    #path: /var/log/mybeat

    # The name of the files where the logs are written to.

    # Number of rotated log files to keep. Oldest files will be deleted first.
